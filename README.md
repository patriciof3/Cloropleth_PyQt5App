# App-Consultora

This is a PyQt5 Desktop app to generate cloropleth maps.

In the company I work we usually have to share the results of public opinion surveys in maps that show the shift of a certain variable in different zones of a city.

I created this app to make it easy for coworkers not used to code, to generate this maps from two main inputs:

1) a csv file with coordinates of each survey 
2) a shp file with the polygons in wich you wish to divide the surveyed area

Then you can establish the name of the variable you will be ploting, the attribute of such variable for wich you want to calculate the percentages, a title for the plot, and a name for the file.
